# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a category of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns. Unlike unsupervised learning, supervised learning algorithms are given labeled training to learn the relationship between the input and the outputs.

A supervised learning algorithm learns from the labeled training data and helps the user predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Algorithms attempt to fit a line to that labeled data to either split it into categories (classification) or represent a trend (regression), and this line allows us to make predictions. Successfully building, scaling, and deploying accurate supervised machine learning data science models takes time and technical expertise from a team of highly skilled data scientists. Moreover, data scientists must rebuild models to make sure the insights remain true until the data changes.

### Supervised learning works with:

* Labeled data
* Direct feedback
* Predict outcome/future


## Types of supervised learning algorithms:

### Classification
**Goal:**    Assign each input value and assign it to a class or category that it fits based on the training data
            predicted output is a list of tags or values
            e.g. spam filters, with tages "spam" or "not spam"
**popular classificaiton algorithms:** linear classifiers, logistic regression, K nearest neighbor classifier, support vector machines, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier

### Regression
goal: find a relationship between dependent and independent variables
predicted output is a target numeric value, given a set of features, and is represented by a line of best fit (for a model with more than two features, this is often a hyperplane)
e.g. price of a car, given: mileage, age, brand, make, model, etc
popular regression algorithms: linear regression, polynomial regression, K neaerest neighbor regression, decision trees regression, support vector regression
