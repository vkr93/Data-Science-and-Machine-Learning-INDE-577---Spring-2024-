[Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) is a type of regression analysis that is used to predict a continuous target variable y based on one or more input features X. The model assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable, and tries to fit a linear function to the data. In single neuron linear regression, a single neuron is used to model the relationship between the input variables and the output variable.

Linear regression has been around for over 200 years and has been studied from every possible. Often different angles have been given different names:

*   **linear model:** a model that assumes a linear relationship between input variables (x) and a single output variable (y), with the goal of calculating y from a linear combination of the input variables (x)
*   **simple linear regression:** when there is a single input variable (x)
*   **Multiple linear regression:** when there are multiple input variables
